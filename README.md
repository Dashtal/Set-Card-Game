# Set-Card-Game
This project was part of the Systems Programming course at Ben Gurion University.
I was passionate about the assignment, and when I got the chance a few months later I went ahead and re-implemented it, making it even faster, more effective and modular.
The assignment was making a safe and correct implementation of the card game "Set", while keeping an active thread for the dealer and each player.
The goal was to practice concurrent programming, and I believe I took it to the extreme in this implementation; with minimum blocking and synchronization between threads, and zero waste of cpu time.
